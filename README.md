# atope-breast-clustering-analysis
A clustering analysis of the ATOPE+Breast Dataset (https://github.com/salvador-moreno/ATOPE-Breast)

## Layered clustering

The main results of this analysis are the different layers in which the variables are grouped: HRV, wellness, and normalized wellness. HRV is helpful to assess the physiological status of the patient, how well is she coping with training.
